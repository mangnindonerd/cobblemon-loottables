# cobblemon-loottables

Adds cobblemon items to vanilla loot tables. The first priority is to update chests, but potentially other loot could be updated as well.
Cobblemon loot is always in seperate pools, meaning it will never decrease the spawnrates of vanilla loot. Only adding new loot to it.
Currently working on adding new chests, prioritizing chests found earlier in the game over late-game.
Could come in conflict with other mods or datapacks that change vanilla loot tables.
Compatability with loot tables from popular datapacks like terralith planned but not a priority.
